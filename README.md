## Business Activities:

* What specific financial problem is the company or project trying to solve?

    The problem BitPay is trying to solve is payment complications that exists in tradtitional banking and payment processing companies such as fraud issues, long time frame to send and recieve payments, expensive intermediary payment processing fees that are more expensive compared to merchant services, wire transfers, and credit card payments. Knowing that bitcoin is a new form of currency that is not tied to a specific type of currency like US Dollar, Euro, etc. Allows businesses and consumers own their own money and have full control of what they can do with it. When bitcoin came in its early stages, the founders wanted to create a platform for consumers and businesses to engage in a seamless and userfirendly way to exchage bitcoin for goods and services. 

* Who is the company's intended customer?  Is there any information about the market size of this set of customers?
What solution does this company offer that their competitors do not or cannot offer? (What is the unfair advantage they utilize?)

    BitPay's intended customers are any individual and business, banks, and financial institutions that possesses or will like to start accepting bitcoin as means for payment. According to market share analysis from enlyst.com, the top three industries that uses BitPay are, Hospital and Health Care, Marketing and Advertisement, and Non-Profit Organizations. 51% of BitPay customers are in the United States followed by United Kingdom at 3% and the rest spread out in different countries around the world. They provide a means to exchange customers' cryptocurrency into dollars and vice versa so that it can provide the flexibility for their customers to use their money wherever they go. As revolutionary as BitPay is being the largest bitcoin payment processor in the world, the market size is based on the online payments is only 0.1%. Authorize.net is the leading online paymnet processing company that has a market share of a little ver 25%, followed by Adyen, Apple Pay, Log-and-Pay with Amazon, and Vanco-Payment Solutions.

    The top competitors of BitPay, when it comes to cryptocurrency exchange, are Coinpayments, Coinbase, and Gocoin. Although these companies offer similar benefits for their customers, such as low 1% transaction fee for all payments, there are differences in payments processing services. According to cryptocolumn.com, "Bitpay is the most affordable Bitcoin processor around. Many of thier opetions are zero transaction fees with zero hidden charges." Since the inception of BitPay in 2011, it has never been hacked providing peace of mind to its clients. It also offers a Bitcoin debit card that helps individual clients access their cryptocurrency anywhere that accepts VISA and providing competitive and guaranteed exchenge rates for crypto to the accepted currency. For merchants who accepts bitcoin as payment, BitPay offers daily bank settlements and flat rate pricing. Daily bank settlements are reports that the last bank receives the report of trasaction(s) from two entities.

## Landscape:

* What domain of the financial industry is the company in?

    Payments and back-end infrastructure is the domain BitPay is in.

* What have been the major trends and innovations of this domain over the last 5-10 years?

    According to an article in Blue Snap, the major trends that have helped shape current year, 2019, will create and grow companies like BitPay to disrupt the traditional ways gateway, payment processing companies, and banks to business. One of the trends mentioned is "B2B billing for small-and-medium sized businesses will transition into digital." Businesses are now in more demand each year to receive payments close to instant fashion versus waiting for checks to be received by mail and credit card accounts recievable to be processed withing 2 business days. Not to mention, the fraud that exists in tradtional methods of payment, checks and credit cards, that does not exist in Bitcoin payment processing platforms, such as BitPay. BitPay mission is to give power and ownership of currency back to the individual and businesses to help process payments in a safer fashion.

    Another past trend was the birth of bitcoin in January 2009 by Satoshi Nakamato who created ideas of using cryptocurrency as universal way of accepting payments. News spread rapidly about "a system for electronic transactions without relying on trust". However, early detections of payment processing volitility has emerged in 2010. Transactions were not being verified to eliminate errors and fraud. Blockchain was developed as a way to log bitcoin transactions and companies, like BitPay, capturing the opportunity to provide a way to process payment transactions close to a speed of sending an email and, so far, eliminating 100%, fraud activity. 

* What are the other major companies in this domain?

    Major companies in the payment domain are PayPal, Due, Stripe, Flagship Merchant Services, Payline Data, Square, Adyen, GoCardless, and Cayan. In the bitcoin payment processing domain, major companies like

## Results

* What has been the business impact of this company so far?

    The impact that it has on businesses as of now is large, Fortune 500  companies are using Bitcoin as a way to accept payments and send payments. Given the fact BitPay only services 1% of its market to large corpaorations, BitPay is growing rapidly with proven results of safe distribution and transactions of cryptocurrency. Avnet, a Fortune 500 company and one of the largest distributors of electronic components and services, started to accept cryptocurrency by using BitPay's blockchain payment processor. Avnet is also working with BitPay to create a new hardware to create a safer way to store bitcoin and bitcoin cash.


* What are some of the core metrics that companies in this domain use to measure success? How is your company performing, based on these metrics?

    In the beginning, BitPay relied on every member of their Customer Success team, to respond to inquiries on BitPay invoices. The rate of inquiry errors started at 1.4%. As low as this was, BitPay was not satisfied and wanted to decrease the error rate to as close to 0 as possible. They made a radical change to this at the end of 2017, by adopting a payment protocol called BIP70. With the new "payment protocol, BitPay is able to reject and refund payments that are too big, too small, or take too long to arrive." This helped significantly reduce the error rate to 0.27%!

    

* How is your company performing relative to competitors in the same domain?

    BitPay is reported currently as the best cryptocurrency payment processing service in the world. However, it is still a drop in the bucket compared to juggarnaut payment processing companines like Authorize.net and Apply Pay that covers the majority of the merchant processing market. Still, BitPay's growth is impressive and projected to replace the traditional way of processing payments in the next 5 years.

## Recommendations

* If you were to advise the company, what products or services would you suggest they offer? (This could be something that a competitor offers, or use your imagination!) * Why do you think that offering this product or service would benefit the company?

    What I will advise the company to collaborate with or compete against is Zelle. Right now, major banks are using the transaction sevices of Zelle to instantly transfer currency domestic currency from one account to another simply by using phone number or email address. If BitPay can be available on Zelle platform to allow bitcoin and currency exchange to take place, it will substantially increase visibility and awareness of Bitcoin to existing and potential clients.


* What technologies would this additional product or service utilize? 

    The technologies in addition to what BitPay is using to run its business to work or have a similar system to Zelle are New Relic and Varnish for the DevOps processes. New Relic is a SaaS application performance management for Ruby, PHP, Java, Python, .Net, and Node .js apps. Varnish is a high-performance HTTP accelerator. BitPay's payment platform and see that maybe it can be compatible with the system/program used by Zelle to add cryptocurrency for transactions.

* Why are these technologies appropriate for your solution?

    I feel that these technologies will helps with fixing any existing errors on BitPay's online and moblie platform. Varnish can help manage at a potentially higher level the large content that exists on BitPay's website and mobile apps.
